<p>I mean seriously, can they just stop doing this? This is horrible. Doctor Who - remake. Highlander as a series - remake. Dune - remake. This Dune remake thing they did really pissed me off. It was the worst thing I had ever never finished seeing. Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes, which included that fat guy from Beetleguice who was never a good actor.</p>

<p>As a friend is so fond of saying, "if it's not worth doing right, it's not worth doing".</p>
