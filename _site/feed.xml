        &lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean seriously, can they just stop doing this? This is horrible. Doctor Who - remake. Highlander as a series - remake. Dune - remake. This Dune remake thing they did really pissed me off. It was the worst thing I had ever never finished seeing. Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes, which included that fat guy from Beetleguice who was never a good actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a friend is so fond of saying, &quot;if it's not worth doing right, it's not worth doing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
